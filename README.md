# Comics_rating


Comics Rating is a React app which randomly generates comics from this API https://xkcd.com/1/info.0.json and can offer the user the ability to rate it.


## Usage

How to use me:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install node_modules dependencies in project folder 'npm install'
3. Run the following command: 'npm run start'
4. A browser window will open with localhost on 8000 port.
5. Download *Moesif* on your Chrome extensions (to allow API request and avoid CORS restriction) - you can go directly here:  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=es
7. Active the extension with the toogle.
8. Enjoy the app!
